#### I'm a software engineer, problem solver, builder 🛠
I started my career working in collaboration with engineers to bring software solutions to the world. I learned that if you want to build a product people love and actually use✨, you have to deeply understand the end users 🕵️‍♀️ first, including how the tool fits into their larger goals. 

Now, I’ve added engineering tools and frameworks to my skillset. I’ve built apps using React, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, CSS, HTML5, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Webpack and other tools. I’ve leveraged APIs from OpenAI, AWS, and Google Maps Platform to enrich the apps I’ve built too. Intrigued? Read on.

#### Before this life, I was problem solving and bridging gaps between engineers and end users
I earned an undergraduate business degree from the University of Michigan and joined the management consulting world in McKinsey’s business technology practice. There, and later at Salesforce, I helped engineers and non-technical folks bridge gaps, define requirements, and deploy software that end users loved. A fun example - I worked with Salesforce’s Einstein AI engineers to tune their sales-focused lead scoring product.

#### I realized I wanted to become an engineer during my latest role at Scale AI, a high-growth AI startup 🤖
I was an early hire and progressed through many roles over 4 years; scoping out the end user’s needs was always key to success. Sometimes the end user was the customer (incredible AI teams), and by understanding their ML roadmaps I coordinated with Scale engineers to deliver solutions that won over 100 deals. Other times the end user was Scale’s ML ops force; I brought many internal software tools into existence, from recognizing the need to collabing with engineers to rollout. Seeing the impact that a single well-scoped engineer could have inspired me to become one 🌟. 

#### So I decided to do something about it!
I found the most rigorous ⚡ and fast-paced coding bootcamp I could and learned to code. Building a vanilla JavaScript browser game, a Rails/React fullstack app, and a team-based MERN fullstack app, I’ve found my brain 🧠 likes this challenge.

#### I'm also a human
One who loves activities that involve elevation change. 
 - If there’s a tall tower or natural landmass, I’m probably atop it, with my camera 📷. 
 - If it‘s a snowy landmass, I’m probably skiing or snowboarding 🏂.
 - If more vertical, then I might be climbing 🧗‍♀️.
 - If there’s water, I’m likely scuba diving 🧜‍♀️. 

If it’s flat farmland… no worries, my third great hobby is hitting up the season’s fruit u-pick 🍒🍓🍎, growing my own hot peppers 🌶, and fermenting cabbage 🥬.

#### Let's build something extraordinary!
