#### I'm a software engineer, problem solver, builder 🛠
I started my career working in collaboration with engineers to bring software solutions to the world. I learned that if you want to build a product people love and actually use✨, you have to deeply understand the end users 🕵️‍♀️ first, including how the tool fits into their larger goals. 

#### Now, I’ve added engineering tools and frameworks to my skillset

I’ve leveraged `OpenAI's API` to enrich the apps I’ve built too. Intrigued? Read on.

#### Before this life, I was problem solving and bridging gaps between engineers and end users
I earned an undergraduate business degree from the University of Michigan and joined the management consulting world in McKinsey’s business technology practice. There, and later at Salesforce, I helped engineers and non-technical folks bridge gaps, define requirements, and deploy software that end users loved. A fun example - I worked with Salesforce’s Einstein AI engineers to tune their sales-focused lead scoring product.

#### I realized I wanted to become an engineer when I was at Scale AI, a high-growth AI startup 🤖
I was an early hire and progressed through many roles over 4 years; scoping out the end user’s needs was always key to success. Sometimes the end user was the customer (incredible AI teams), and by understanding their ML roadmaps I coordinated with Scale engineers to deliver solutions that won over 100 deals. [Here's my approach.](https://scale.com/blog/partnering-with-customers)

Other times the end user was Scale’s ML ops force; I brought many internal software tools into existence, from recognizing the need to collabing with engineers to rollout. Seeing the impact that a single well-scoped engineer could have inspired me to become one 🌟. 

#### So I decided to do something about it!
I found the most rigorous ⚡ and fast-paced coding bootcamp I could and learned to code. Building a vanilla JavaScript browser game, a Rails/React fullstack app, and a team-based MERN fullstack app, I’ve found my brain 🧠 likes this challenge.

#### I'm also a human
One who loves activities that involve elevation change. 
 - If there’s a tall tower or natural landmass, I’m probably atop it, with my camera 📷. 
 - If it‘s a snowy landmass, I’m probably skiing or snowboarding 🏂.
 - If more vertical, then I might be climbing 🧗‍♀️.
 - If there’s water, I’m likely scuba diving 🧜‍♀️. 

If it’s flat… no worries, my third great hobby is hitting up the season’s fruit u-pick 🍒🍓🍎, growing my own hot peppers 🌶, and fermenting cabbage 🥬.

#### Let's build something extraordinary!
